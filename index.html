        <h1>All About Koala</h1>
        <p>I am at the beginning of my journey to becoming a self-taught coder.
          My beautiful girlfriend got me started on <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> and she has been really supportive so far.
          I am also learning from watching through the web developer tutorials from <strong>The App Brewery</strong> by Angela Yu.
          I hope to be able to build many awesome, functional and accessible websites soon.
          This is my first personal website and it is a showcase of what I have learned using html, css and javascript. </p>

        <p><em>
            I currently work at a top tier London tourist attraction for their front of house team.
            I have worked in the service industry for nearly 10 years and have honed vital people skills
            that are necessary to work well as part of a successful team. I did previously
            attend university where I studied Biology in which I carry over transferable skills from that too.</em>

  <h3>Personal Information</h3>
  <p>I have Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD).
    It is pervasive.
    I struggle in everyday situations.
    The "simple" interactions that I have with others rapidly deplete any mental energy I may have on a day-to-day basis.
  </p>
  <p>I am LGBTQ+. </p>
  <p>I am a POC.</p>
